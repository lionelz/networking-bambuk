This directory contains deployment scripts to test bambuk in large scale.
The scripts are not to be used directly "Out of the box", but rather need
customization for the specific envronment.
First, a template machine should be created, the scripts assume that the 
machine disk is a file of qcow2 format and its name is the same as the 
name of the VM. (Though it is easy to get the name of the file from the vm
itself, this is still work to be done).

Note: As the IP addressing of the VMs only changes the last octet, the
scripts are limited to creating up to 254 VMs.

Before creating VMs, one should edit the configure.sh script in the templates
directory, and set the names of the interfaces to reflect the actual names of
the interfaces in the template VMm, and the relevant IP networks.
Also, the create_vm.sh script should be modified accordingly.

The usage to create multiple VMs is something like this:
#./prepare.sh <template VM name>
#for i in {1..50}; do ./create_vm new_vm$i $i; done

This should create 50 VMs based on the template VM.
Note that you can modify the configure.sh script to perform any specific
configuration for the VMs before they start.
